## Anagrams

This is an experimental app that I am playing with. It's going to be
an implementation of the game
["anagrams"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagrams_(game)) but the
point is to learn Rails 8 and especially modern Javascript techniques,
such as:

* [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) / [ActionCable](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html)
* ES6 [modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
* [Import maps](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html)
* [Turbo](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails)

It also includes a [Nix](https://nixos.org/) shell setup for easy
development and deployment. Run `nix-shell` in this directory to start
developing!
